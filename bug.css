The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, causing unexpected layout issues.  Specifically, the calculation `width: calc(100% - 20px)` is applied to an element inside a container that doesn't have its own width explicitly set.  This causes the calculation to return an unexpected width, usually 0px. The element is expected to take up the full width of the container, minus 20px padding.
